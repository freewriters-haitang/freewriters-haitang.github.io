## Headline: Queer, women’s writing, and the police atrocity in China

Mo Xiang Tong Xiu,  Chinese author well-known for her danmei (the Chinese equivalent of the Yaoi Genre) novels, was put to jail in 2018 for “illegal publication.”

Since then, she has gone silent and has not released any new works.

Now, similar incidents are happening again—this time to more Chinese female young authors, with more cruelty. These college girls and young adults are facing police interrogation and cruel treatment, And we need your attention.

Haitang Literature is a Chinese-language website specializing in adult-oriented yaoi fiction, where some of the contents are reserved for paying readers. Since June 2024, many authors on the site have stopped updating and went missing. These young female writers disappeared with no public awareness, until some authors and their families revealed on internet that over fifty authors were quietly detained by the Anhui provincial police. Some were even sent to prison.

On June 1, 2025, the second round of hunting the young females broke out. Authorities in China call it “deep-sea fishing”, a trans-regional policing campaign led by Lanzhou Police. This time, the crackdown extended to any writers on the Haitang Literature website. Profited from the writing or not, they were summoned by police, and threatened with huge fines or jail time while in custody. Even those who had never published explicit material were humiliated by police for being “immoral”. The police even went after readers based on their payment records too, using reading histories and IP addresses to identify the writers for further questioning. This is a blatant disregard of due process, and is a grave violation of freedom of expression and individual’s privacy rights.

This appalling news only drew very limited attention on Chinese social media. Although BBC China and a few independent outlets reported on the issue, no in-depth investigations were conducted. Without public attention, the writers are facing the police power alone.

Chinese is a beautiful language, and mainland China is home to many brilliant young content creators. They deserve the freedom to express, create, and love. They deserve the freedom from censorship and oppression, and the freedom from fear.

If we cannot defend the freedom to write, then we do not have the freedom to think, to act according to our will, and to love whomever we choose.

It is a human right to talk about love, sex, same-sex sexual activities, and create explicit fiction. The needs and desires of women—and of people across the spectrum of sexualities—deserves to be written, expressed, and seen.
