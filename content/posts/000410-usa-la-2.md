美国洛杉矶，6月9日，骄傲游行

这让我想起AO3名字的由来：AO3的原名“archive of our own”，最初来源于书籍《一间自己的房间》，书中的名句“若一个女人决意要写小说，她必须有钱，而且还要有一间属于她自己的房间”

“有一种误解是写同人小说的人都是些12岁小女孩，确实也有一些12岁的女孩（写同人小说），她们都是很棒的作家……我会为那些写小说的12岁女孩战斗到死。总有一天她们会统治世界。但不仅仅是她们。”——AO3联合创始人 Francesca Coppa

我会永远为你们战斗的。

In her essay, Woolf uses metaphors to explore social injustices and comments in women’s lack of free expression. her metaphor of a fish explain a her most essential point, “A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.” She writes of a woman whose thought had “let its line down into the stream.” As the woman starts to think of an idea, a guard enforces a rule whereby women are not allowed to walk on the grass. Abiding by the rule, the woman loses her idea

“There is a misconception that people who write fanfiction are all like 12-year-old girls, and there are 12-year-old girls [who write fanfiction].and by the way, they are fantastic writers. I will fight to death for those 12-year-old girls who are writing fiction. They are going to run the world someday. But it’s not only them”by the co-founder of AO3, Francesca Coppa

I will fight for you, always.
